# Leaflet visualization Challenge - Visualizing United States Geological Survery (USGS) Earthquake Data

## Background

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, the task was to develop a way to visualize USGS data that will allow USGS to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### Before opening the starterCode folder

1. I created a new repository in GitHub for this project called `leaflet-challenge`. 
2. Inside the new repository I cloned the new repository to my computer.
3. Inside my local Git repository, I created a folder titled Leaflet-Part-1. I then added the files from the StarterCode folder that was within the Module 15 Challenge zip file.  The folder included the following:
   - a folder titled "image" with several *.png files for reference,
   - a folder titled "static" that included a starter javascript code file titled "logic.js" and a starter style file titled "style.css", 
   - an index.html file
5. I copied the starter code that was provided by our class instructor, to help us get started with the assignment, to the logic.js file.

## Steps for Building the Earthquake Map Visualization

1. The USGS provides earthquake data, that is updated every 5 minutes, in a number of different formats.  Visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php page and chose a dataset to visualize.
   
2. Selected the dataset "All Earthquakes from the past 7 days" via a JSON representation of that data.  Used the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.
    
3. Imported and visualized the data by doing the following:
